# Data Science for Chemistry and Engineering

**Course numbers:** CHEM 452 / CHBE 413  
**Semester:** Fall 2025  
**Meeting time:** Tuesday & Thursday, 3:00–4:20 PM  
**Location:** 163 Noyes Laboratory  

**Instructor:** Prof. Nick Jackson (Noyes Lab 350E, [jacksonn@illinois.edu](mailto:jacksonn@illinois.edu))  
**Teaching Assistant:** Jingdan Chen ([jingdan2@illinois.edu](mailto:jingdan2@illinois.edu))

This course introduces advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students in chemistry and
chemical engineering to modern data science and machine learning, with a strong emphasis on
