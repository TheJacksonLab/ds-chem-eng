# Resources

This page collects references, textbooks, tutorials, and software tools that support
**Data Science for Chemistry and Engineering**.

---

## Core Textbooks

These are the primary books used in the course:

1. **An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Python (ISL)**  
   James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani.  
   - Focus: classical statistical learning (regression, classification, resampling, etc.).  
   - Freely available online.

2. **Understanding Deep Learning (UDL)**  
   Simon J.D. Prince.  
   - Focus: deep learning theory and practice.  
   - Freely available online.

## Software and Computing Environment

We will primarily use **Google Colab** and the **Jupyter notebook** ecosystem.

### Required / Common Python Libraries

- `numpy` – numerical arrays and linear algebra  
- `scipy` – scientific computing routines  
- `pandas` – data frames and tabular data handling  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – plotting and visualization  
- `scikit-learn` – classical ML algorithms and utilities  
- `tensorflow` / `keras` – deep learning frameworks  
- `rdkit` – cheminformatics toolkit (molecules, SMILES, descriptors)

### Example Notebook Links

Once your GitHub repository is populated, you can add direct links here, for example:

```markdown
- [Intro Python Notebook (GitHub)]({{ '/notebooks/CDS25_IntroPython.ipynb' | relative_url }})  
- [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TheJacksonLab/ds-chem-eng/blob/main/notebooks/CDS25_IntroPython.ipynb)
```

Organize notebooks under the `notebooks/` folder, e.g.:

- `notebooks/` – lecture notebooks  
- `homework/` – homework notebooks  
- `projects/` – example project notebooks
