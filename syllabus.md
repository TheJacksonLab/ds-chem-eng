## Course Description and Learning Outcomes

This course introduces data science and machine learning for advanced undergraduates and early
graduate students in chemistry and chemical engineering. A central component is a **practical
programming lab** in which students implement methods discussed in lecture using Python and
Jupyter notebooks in Google Colab.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. Process and featurize datasets relevant to chemistry and chemical engineering.  
2. Perform supervised and unsupervised machine learning using Python.  
3. Quantify and assess the performance of machine-learning models.  
4. Critique models in the context of the **bias–variance tradeoff**.  
5. Understand and apply common neural-network architectures using **Keras**.  
6. Apply machine learning to **experimental optimization campaigns**.  
7. Follow best practices in the machine-learning community.  
8. Understand how data science and ML are used in the **chemical industry**.  
9. Function effectively on a team: provide leadership, set goals, tasks, and objectives.

## Programming Environment

Programming is an integral part of this course.

- Primary language: **Python**
- Primary environment: **Jupyter notebooks in Google Colab**
- Requirements:
  - A valid Google account to access Google Colab.
  - Ability to write and run Python code in notebooks.

At least the following libraries will be used:

- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `keras`
- `tensorflow`
- `rdkit`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`

Supplementary Python programming reviews will be uploaded to the course website to ease
differences in programming background.

## Grading and Assessments

### Components

- **Homework (10 assignments):** 40%  
- **Exam 1 (48-hour take-home):** 15%  
- **Exam 2 (48-hour take-home):** 15%  
- **Final Project:** 30%
  - Written report & GitHub code: 20%
  - Oral presentation: 10%

### Grading Scale and Curve

Grades are curved with a **median in the B/B+ range**. The curve can only help you – it cannot
hurt you. Minimum guaranteed letter grade thresholds:

- 90% → at least **A-**  
- 80% → at least **B-**  
- 70% → at least **C-**  
- 60% → at least **D-**

### Exams

There are two 48-hour take-home exams. These mirror the format and style of the weekly
programming assignments.

- Exam windows and due dates are listed on the
  [Lecture Schedule]({{ '/lectures' | relative_url }}).
- Make-ups will be scheduled to accommodate valid absences.  
  Appropriate documentation is required.

### Final Project

The course culminates in a **team-based final project** on an advanced machine-learning topic
not fully covered in the lectures. Project details, suggested topics, deliverables, and grading
rubric are provided on the [Final Project]({{ '/project' | relative_url }}) page.

## Homework Policies

1. **Submission format.**  
   - Submit **both**:
     - A PDF export of your Jupyter notebook, and
     - The **executable Jupyter notebook** (`.ipynb`) itself.  
   - Code must be properly commented following good practices  
     (e.g. see the StackOverflow blog post on code comments).  
   - Upload all files to the appropriate homework folder on Canvas by **5 pm** on the
     posted due date.

2. **Show your work.**  
   - Provide explanations that allow the grader to follow your solutions.  
   - Mathematical derivations and algorithms should be accompanied by text that explains
     your reasoning.  
   - Clearly state and justify any assumptions, simplifications, or use of physical or
     mathematical intuition.

3. **Collaboration policy.**  
   - You are encouraged to discuss **concepts and approaches** with classmates.  
   - However, all submitted work must be **your own**:
     - No jointly prepared solutions.
     - Do not share or copy code or written answers.  
   - Academic integrity rules from the department and the University Student Code apply
     in full.

4. **Late policy.**  
   - Please aim to submit homework on time.  
   - If you need an extension, contact the instructor or TA **before** the deadline.  
   - By default:
     - Late submissions incur a **50% deduction**.  
     - No points are awarded for homework submitted **after solutions are posted**.

For a week-by-week view of when homeworks are assigned and due, see the
[Assignments]({{ '/assignments' | relative_url }}) page.

## Office Hours and Communication

### Office Hours

- Professor and TA office hours are listed at the top of this page and on the
  [Home]({{ '/' | relative_url }}) page.
- There are **no bad questions** – you are strongly encouraged to come and ask.

### Outside of Office Hours

- Email is the best way to contact the instructor:
  [jacksonn@illinois.edu](mailto:jacksonn@illinois.edu)  
- We will reply as quickly as possible, but please do not expect an immediate response.  
- Include the **course number** (“CHEM 452 / CHBE 413”) in the subject line to help us
  triage course emails.

## University Policies and Student Support

### Academic Integrity

The University expects all members of the community to uphold the highest standards of
integrity, honesty, respect, and civility.

- Academic misconduct (cheating, plagiarism, etc.) is a serious form of fraud and will not
  be tolerated.
- When you attach your name to a submission, you affirm that:
  - The work is your own,
  - You contributed to it, and
  - You understand everything in it.
- Suspected violations will be reported through the University’s FAIR system and handled
  according to the **Student Code, Article 1, Part 4**.

Students are responsible for knowing and following the University’s academic integrity
policies.

### Disability Services

Students requiring accommodations should:

1. Contact **Disability Resources and Educational Services (DRES)**  
   - 1207 South Oak Street

2. Inform the instructor as early as possible (ideally at the start of the semester) so that
   accommodations can be implemented.

### Religious Observances

Illinois law requires reasonable accommodation of students’ religious beliefs, observances,
and practices.

- Review the syllabus early for potential conflicts between course deadlines and your
  religious observances.
- If a conflict exists, notify the instructor within the **first two weeks** of classes and
  follow the procedure described by the Office of the Dean of Students to request
  accommodations.

### Mental Health and Well-Being

### Use of Electronic Devices and Class Courtesy

- Cell phones and other electronic devices must be **turned off** during lecture.  
- Laptops are permitted **only** for in-class coding exercises.  
- Please avoid side conversations and other distracting behavior.  
  Respect your classmates’ time and learning environment.

### Emergency Preparedness

- Take a few minutes to identify all exits from the building and the classroom.  
- Sign up for emergency text messages via the campus emergency website.  
- For more information on emergency preparedness (including guidance on “run, hide, fight”
  and building floor plans), consult the campus safety website.
