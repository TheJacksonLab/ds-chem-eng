# Final Project: Advanced Topics in Chemical Data Science and Engineering

The frontier of machine learning is evolving rapidly. The lectures provide a survey of “greatest
hits” methods and the foundations needed to understand new techniques as they emerge. The
**final project** gives you the opportunity to **dig deeply** into an advanced topic that is not
covered (or only minimally covered) in the standard lecture schedule.

You will work in teams to:

1. Explore an advanced ML method.
2. Apply it to a concrete problem in chemistry, chemical engineering, or materials science.
3. Implement the method in a Jupyter notebook using a real dataset.
4. Communicate your findings in a written report and oral presentation.

## Project Logistics

- **Team size:** 4 students per team.
- **Team formation:** You are responsible for organizing your own teams.
- **Meeting with instructor:** Each team must schedule a meeting with Prof. Jackson to discuss
  project ideas and scope.

### Important Dates

| Milestone | Date |
|-----------|------|
| Project team members due | **Sep 28** |
| Project topics due | **Oct 19** |
| Written reports and code due | **Nov 30** |
| In-class presentations | **Nov 30** and **Dec 5** (corresponding to Dec 4 and Dec 9 class meetings) |

> *Both* a hard-copy written report and electronic code submission (via GitHub) are required.

## Suggested Project Topics

Projects should focus on **advanced ML methods** and **chemical or engineering applications**.
The following are non-exhaustive suggestions drawn from previous offerings and current
research activity.

### Example Projects from Previous Years

- Integrating LLM embeddings and LSTMs to predict protein B-factors from sequence.  
- Isolation forests for anomaly detection of degradation in Li-ion batteries.  
- Predicting yields of Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reactions.  
- Bayesian optimization of molecular species for targeted properties.  
- Active learning of cyclic voltammogram data.  
- Graph neural networks for enantiomeric systems.  
- Deep reinforcement learning for de novo small-molecule design to maximize solubility.

### Ideas for Methods to Explore

- Interpretable / explainable AI  
- Symbolic regression  
- Advanced nonlinear dimensionality reduction  
- Diffusion models  
- Variational autoencoders  
- Other modern architectures or workflows relevant to chemical data science

You are welcome to propose your own topic, provided it:

1. Involves a substantive machine-learning or data-science method, and  
2. Is applied to a clearly defined problem in chemistry, chemical engineering, or materials.

## Deliverables

### 1. Method and Application Definition

- Clearly identify the **methodological topic** (e.g., diffusion models, symbolic regression).  
- Clearly define the **domain-specific application** (e.g., reaction yield prediction, battery
  degradation diagnostics, polymer property prediction).

### 2. Working Code and Dataset

- Implement at least a **simple example** of the method applied to your chosen problem using a
  **real chemical/engineering dataset**.
- Your code should live in a Jupyter notebook (or notebooks) and be uploaded to the **course
  GitHub** repository.
- Your workflow should respect good data-science hygiene:
  - Train/validation/test splits
  - Cross-validation where appropriate
  - Proper handling of leakage, scaling, and hyperparameter tuning

### 3. Written Report

- Length: ~10–15 pages, single-spaced, Times New Roman (including figures and references).  
- Figures: No more than **five** figures.  
- References: No more than **20** references.

The report should include:

1. **Abstract (≤ 250 words).**  
   Clearly state the rationale, scientific objective, and potential impact of achieving the
   objective.

2. **Background and Motivation.**  
   Introduce the method and explain why it is appropriate for your chosen application.

3. **Technical Description of the Method.**  
   Provide a rigorous yet accessible description of the underlying theory and algorithms.

4. **Implementation and Results.**  
   Describe your dataset, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and key findings.

5. **Discussion and Conclusions.**  
   Reflect on model performance, limitations, and potential future directions.

6. **References.**  
   Include titles and follow a consistent citation style.

### 4. Oral Presentation

- Length: **15 minutes** per team, followed by brief Q&A.  
- Goal: Explain the story behind your project and make the science accessible to your
  classmates, using concepts and techniques covered in the course.

Every team member must speak during the presentation.

## Getting Started

Some tips to get your project moving:

1. **Form a team early** and brainstorm topics aligned with your interests.  
2. **Survey the literature** to find a recent method or application that excites you.  
3. **Meet with Prof. Jackson** to refine the scope and ensure feasibility within the semester.  
4. Start with a **simple baseline model**, then layer in your advanced method.  
5. Make sure your code is clean, documented, and reproducible.

This project is a chance to explore the cutting edge of chemical data science—have fun with it!
