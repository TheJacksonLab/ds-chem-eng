# Assignments, Exams, and Grading

This course uses **10 weekly Jupyter-notebook homework assignments**, **two 48-hour take-home
exams**, and a **team-based final project**.

See the [Lecture Schedule]({{ '/lectures' | relative_url }}) for when each homework is introduced
and due.

---

## Homework Overview

- Homeworks are implemented as **executable Jupyter notebooks**.
- Submit **both**:
  - A PDF export of your notebook, and
  - The `.ipynb` file itself.
- All code must be **well-commented** and your reasoning clearly explained.
- Submit via Canvas by **5 pm on the due date**.

### Homework Timing (Tentative)

| HW | Assigned | Due | Notes |
|----|----------|-----|-------|
| 1 | Aug 28 | Sep 4 | Python and numerical computing warm-up |
| 2 | Sep 4 | Sep 11 | Exploratory data analysis & basic regression |
| 3 | Sep 11 | Sep 18 | Regularization and partial least squares |
| 4 | Sep 18 | Sep 25 | Molecular featurization and classification |
| 5 | Sep 25 | Oct 2 | SVMs and tree-based models |
| 6 | Oct 2 | Oct 9 | Gaussian processes and active learning |
| 7 | Oct 16 | Oct 23 | Unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction |
| 8 | Oct 23 | Oct 30 | Explainable AI and model interpretation |
| 9 | Oct 30 | Nov 6 | Introductory neural networks |
|10 | Nov 6 | Nov 13 | Advanced neural networks (CNNs / GNNs) |

*(Exact homework topics may shift slightly as the course evolves, but the timing is tied to the
lecture schedule.)*

You can link each homework notebook and PDF here once they are created, for example:

- HW1 – Intro Python and NumPy  
  - [HW1 Instructions (PDF)]({{ '/assets/homework/hw1/hw1_instructions.pdf' | relative_url }})  
  - [HW1 Starter Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TheJacksonLab/ds-chem-eng/blob/main/homework/hw1/CDS25_HW1.ipynb)
```

## Exams

### Exam 1 (Take-home, 48 hours)

- **Window opens:** Oct 14  
- **Due:** Oct 16  
- **Format:** Jupyter-notebook style problems similar to weekly homeworks, emphasizing topics
  from the first part of the course (regression, classification, model assessment, active
  learning, etc.).

### Exam 2 (Take-home, 48 hours)

- **Window opens:** Nov 18  
- **Due:** Nov 20  
- **Format:** Notebook-style exam focusing on later course material (neural networks, deep
  learning architectures, sequence models, attention).

Both exams are individual work, covered by the same academic integrity expectations as the
homeworks.

If you miss an exam window for a **valid, documented reason**, contact the instructor as soon
as possible to arrange a make-up.

## Final Project

The **final project** is worth **30%** of your course grade and is completed in teams of four.

Key components:

- Topic selection on an advanced ML method  
- Application to a chemical/engineering dataset  
- Working Jupyter notebook and code on GitHub  
- Written report (~10–15 pages, single-spaced)  
- 15-minute in-class presentation

All details, including suggested topics, deadlines, and the grading rubric, are provided on the
[Final Project]({{ '/project' | relative_url }}) page.

## Late and Collaboration Policies (Summary)

- **Collaboration:** Discussion of concepts is encouraged, but all submitted work must be your
  own. No shared code or jointly prepared solutions.
- **Late submissions:** 50% penalty for late homework; no credit after solutions are posted.
- **Academic integrity:** All University and departmental policies apply. See the
  [Syllabus]({{ '/syllabus' | relative_url }}) for the full statement.
